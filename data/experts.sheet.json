    "comment": "Can the Seahawks win 10 games again this season? With an elite QB in his prime, there’s no reason why not. I’m putting a lot of faith in Russell Wilson to make the plays when it counts the most, and especially at home, to lift a team that figures to rely on its offense to win more than ever. Like last year, it may all come down to the final two games at home to determine a playoff berth.",

But here’s to the #BodyBlow theory, and a nod to a star-studded backfield protected by a strong offensive line, leading to a late-season surge for the NFC’s final playoff berth.",

    "comment": "Offensively, there are intriguing ingredients here. Russell Wilson could be the best he’s ever been, with perhaps the best offensive line he’s ever had protecting him. Brian Schottenheimer wants to run the football, and both Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny can do that effectively. Tyler Lockett was a legitimate No. 1 wide receiver last season, though it’s unclear who else – paging DK Metcalf – will carry the load on the outside. On the other side, the Seahawks tout perhaps the premier linebacker corps in the league … along with big-time questions in the secondary as well as on the defensive line. The Seahawks will compete, but they won’t reach the playoffs for the second consecutive season.",

    "comment": "This just has the feeling of another 10-win season for Pete Carroll and the Seahawks. (Seattle has compiled 10 wins in three of the past four seasons.) With QB Russell Wilson at the helm, Seattle have never won fewer than nine games the past seven years. Despite legitimate concerns with the pass rush and the secondary, the Hawks appear to have more talent at the start of the season than last year when Seattle finished 10-6. The first nine games are relatively favorable before a daunting five-game stretch that include trips to San Francisco, Philadelphia , LA Rams and Charlotte as well as a home game against Minnesota.",

    "comment": "The Seahawks defied preseason pessimism last year by going 10-6 and earning a wild-card playoff berth. However, that required winning six of their last seven games after a 4-5 start. Now they will try to ride that momentum into not just another playoff spot but a home game in the postseason, which will require beating out the Rams, fresh off a Super Bowl season. They can do that if Russell Wilson and the offense perform like it did in the second half (excluding the playoff loss to Dallas, of course), and if the defense finds answers to several potential problem areas. Foremost amongst them: Finding a replacement for all the sacks lost by the trade of Frank Clark and suspension of Jarran Reed.",

    "comment": "In 2018 the Seahawks successfully rebooted their offense (in the regular season, at least), led the NFL in rushing and returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. The run game still appears to be in good shape, although the offense took a hit with receiver Doug Baldwin’s retirement. The defense features a potentially dominating linebacking corps, but the line and secondary have issues. That’s too much to overcome, and I see the Seahawks sitting out the postseason.",

    "comment": "A surprisingly strong 2018 season followed by locking up two major pieces in Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner has the Seahawks primed for an even stronger 2019 at first glance. However, questions at receiver and in the secondary loom large. If Wilson can play out of his mind and up to his contract’s lofty expectations, and if the Seahawks defensive line can effectively replace Frank Clark (and Jarran Reed for six games), maybe Seattle can steal a couple more wins and best last year’s 10-6 mark.",

With a loaded NFC and question marks on both sides of the ball, It'll be a tall task for the Seahawks to get to double-digit wins and a playoff berth in 2019. But, questions aside, Seattle still has arguably the best linebacking corps in football, plenty of talented young players, a top-tier rushing attack and, of course, Russell. That combination will be enough to eek into a Wild Card spot.",
